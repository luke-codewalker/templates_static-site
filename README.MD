# templates_static-site

A template for a simple static site meant to be used with degit.

## About

I got tired of typing out the same code every time I wanted to setup a simple static site to try something out. I also really wanted to be able to code comfortably with Typecript and SCCS even in small projects in my free time. This is what this template is for. It uses Rollup and the configuration is heavily inspired by the Svelte starter template: https://github.com/sveltejs/template. 

This template is customized to my needs and preferences and meant for simple prototypes not production apps. Feel free to use it as described below or make your own fork to customize it.

## How to scaffold a new project

Copy the template:

```
npx degit luke-codewalker/templates_static-site your-project-name
```

Install the dependencies and run the development script:

```
npm i && npm start
```

You can then go to http://localhost:5000 in your browser and start hacking ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰!
